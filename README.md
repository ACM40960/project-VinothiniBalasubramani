In the tumultuous climate of the **COVID-19** pandemic, nations globally faced unparalleled public health trials, with the UK standing out as one of the most significantly affected. This project seeks to deeply investigate the palpable effects of the vaccination campaign on COVID-19 metrics like infections, hospitalizations, and mortality rates in the UK. Through multivariate linear regression analyses of data spanning pre-vaccination and vaccination periods, we aim to unravel the real-world efficacy of vaccines while accounting for other external influences like human mobility and weather patterns. Our findings aspire to shape public health policies by emphasizing the crucial role of vaccinations in our fight against the pandemic.

## Overview

🚀 **Introduction**: This project offers a comprehensive exploration of the distinctive challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a particular emphasis on understanding the context and outcomes within the UK. By delving into the experiences and responses of the UK in the face of this global crisis, the project seeks to unravel the intricate dynamics that have shaped the nation's journey through the pandemic. This approach provides an insightful lens through which to examine the multifaceted aspects of public health, policy interventions, and societal resilience.

💡 **Objectives**: 
-	Analyze the correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 outcomes in the UK.
-	Explore the impact of human mobility on the virus's transmission during pre-vaccination and vaccination periods.
-	Examine potential associations between weather patterns and COVID-19 metrics to elucidate any indirect influences.

## Data Exploration

🗄️**Data Source**: Our principal dataset for this investigation is acquired from Google's extensive open data collection, which chronicles COVID-19 details for a plethora of nations. For our study, we focused on extracting data pertinent to the UK, delving into its unique COVID-19 landscape. This rich dataset encapsulates a wide array of variables, including but not limited to confirmed cases, mortality rates, testing frequencies, hospitalization statistics, vaccination data, mobility trends, meteorological metrics, and the government's stringency index. The comprehensive nature of this data repository offers us an unparalleled window into the multifaceted dynamics of COVID-19, enriching the analytical depth of our project.

✂️ **Data Segmentation**: Our analysis segregates the data timeline into two pivotal eras - the _pre-vaccination_ and the _vaccination stages_. This bifurcation aids in a granular examination of various influencers like testing frequencies, mobility trajectories, stringency policies, and meteorological patterns across these two distinct phases. As we transition into the vaccination epoch, our scrutiny deepens to encapsulate the direct repercussions of vaccination on the metrics of confirmed cases, fatalities, and hospitalizations. 

## Methodology

Our endeavor to understand the profound impact of COVID-19 vaccinations in the UK led us to utilize **Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR)**, a potent statistical technique adept at revealing intricate relationships among multiple variables. Prior to delving into the specifics for the UK, we scrutinized the main dataset for multicollinearity. By identifying and removing correlated independent variables and static variables, we ensured the robustness of our subsequent analyses. Post this essential preprocessing step, we partitioned the data into two distinct phases for the UK - pre-vaccination and vaccination period capturing the evolving dynamics of the pandemic.

The implementation of the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) method involves the following steps:

🔍 **Data Preprocessing**: Beyond the initial multicollinearity assessment, we meticulously managed missing data, cleaned our datasets, and ensured their uniformity.

📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This phase involved delving deep into variable distributions, discerning relationships, and identifying potential outliers to build a comprehensive understanding of our data.

#### The plots shown below help to understand the trends of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the pre-vaccination data set:

A discernible trend is evident in the pre-vaccination data set: as the days progress, there is a marked increase in the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.

#### The plots shown below help to understand the trends of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the vaccination data set:

In the vaccination data set, there is a conspicuous decline in the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths as the days unfold.

🧱**Model Building:** Harnessing the power of MLR, we constructed models for both pre-vaccination and vaccination periods, aiming to capture the multifaceted influences on infection rates, hospitalizations, and fatalities.

✅**Model Evaluation:** Our models were put to the test. We gauged their efficacy using metrics like R-squared and employed cross-validation techniques for a holistic assessment.

📑**Comparison Analysis:** A comparative study between our models allowed us to discern the tangible impacts of vaccination campaigns, providing clarity on its role amidst other influencing factors.

The analytical might of MLR, combined with our structured approach and diligent data pre-processing, offered invaluable insights into the pandemic's dynamics, showcasing the multifaceted dimensions of the pandemic in the UK.

## Pre-Vaccination Analysis

Employed __Multivariate Linear Regression__ to analyze relationships between COVID-19 outcomes and various predictors including testing rates, mobility patterns, weather metrics, and the stringency index.

📈**Performance:** Achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.102 on test data with an R-squared value of approximately 0.80 or higher for each response. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained is 0.3207. Thus, the model seems to perform well on the pre-vaccination data, as indicated by a high R<sup>2</sup> value and relatively low error metrics (MSE and RMSE).  The high R<sup>2</sup> value indicates that the model explains a significant amount of variance in the data.

🗝️**Key Findings:**

-	Strong positive correlation between cumulative tests and confirmed cases, deceased cases, and hospitalized patients.
-	Higher stringency index values correlated with an increase in cases.
-	Mobility reductions, especially in retail and transit stations, showed a negative correlation   with case numbers.

## Vaccination Period Analysis

Extended the multivariate regression analysis to capture the dynamics post-vaccination.

📈**Performance:** Demonstrated an improved Mean Squared Error of 0.0702 on test data with R-squared values consistently over 0.80.The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) obtained is 0.2692. The model's performance on the vaccination data is even better than its performance on the pre-vaccination data. This is evident from the improved (lower) error metrics (both MSE and RMSE) and the consistently high R<sup>2</sup> values. The improvements suggest that the model is more accurate in predicting outcomes during the vaccination period compared to the pre-vaccination period.

🗝️**Key Findings:**
-	Significant negative correlation between the number of vaccinated individuals and infection cases, deceased cases, and hospitalizations.
-	Decline in transit station activity correlated with reduced cases and hospitalizations.
-	Testing rates remained pivotal in affecting case numbers, even post-vaccination.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

🏁 **Implications**: In our extensive analysis of COVID-19 dynamics and vaccination impact, several pivotal insights surfaced:

i) Testing remains paramount in understanding the pandemic's trajectory, with a direct correlation seen across essential metrics.

ii) Vaccination emerged as a crucial mitigator, with data overwhelmingly supporting its effectiveness in curbing the virus's devastation.

iii) Mobility, particularly in public spaces, significantly influences the spread, suggesting the importance of monitoring and managing public movements.

iv) Stringency measures by governments, though effective to an extent, yield optimal results when synergized with a robust vaccination drive.

v) Weather, intriguingly, has its indirect yet noteworthy influence, with warmer climates showing a promising correlation with diminished infections.

In essence, the investigation underscores the importance of a multi-pronged approach to Covid-19 control, where testing, vaccination, controlled mobility, stringent government measures, and an understanding of weather interplays are vital in steering us towards a safer tomorrow.

🔮 **Future Scope**: Future studies could probe the impact of vaccination on emerging COVID-19 variants, the role of vaccine boosters, and the synergistic effects of public health measures combined with vaccination.
